The project aims to conduct a comparative analysis of DenseNet and GoogleLeNet for 
the purpose of detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images.


Objective:
The objective of this study is to implement compare two well-known convolutional neural network structures,
 DenseNet and GoogleLeNet (Inception), in order to identify pneumonia in chest X-ray pictures. 
 The project will employ the "Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)" dataset from Kaggle, which consists of a 
 significant quantity of paediatric chest X-ray images that have been categorised as either normal or pneumonia.

The project has the following specific objectives:

Model Implementation: The objective is to modify and apply the DenseNet and GoogleLeNet architectures to accurately identify pneumonia in chest X-ray pictures. 
This requires adjusting the models to effectively process the input image dimensions and accurately classify the output categories.

Performance Evaluation: The purpose is to train and assess both models using the dataset. 
Metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall will be used to measure their ability to diagnose pneumonia.

Efficiency Analysis: This analysis aims to quantify and compare the computing efficiency of both models in terms of the time required for training and inference. 
The goal is to gain a better understanding of how both models can be practically applied in real-world scenarios.

Complexity Assessment: The complexity of both models will be analysed and compared, taking into account criteria such as the total number of 
parameters and the depth of the network.

Hyperparameter Optimisation: It involves changing the parameters like as learning rate, batch size, and number of layers for each model 
to evaluate their impact on performance.

Generalisation Capability: The ability to assess the models' capacity to perform well on new and unseen data by employing
cross-validation techniques, thus insuring their strength and dependability.

Thorough Comparison: This aims to present a full analysis of the two models using the gathered data, allowing for conclusions to be drawn regarding 
their individual strengths and weaknesses in the specific context of detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray pictures.

This project will provide valuable insights into the efficacy of DenseNet and GoogleLeNet architectures in medical image analysis, 
specifically for the crucial healthcare application of pneumonia detection. It will also help in selecting suitable deep learning models for similar tasks.
